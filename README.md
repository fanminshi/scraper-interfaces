COVID19 Scraper Interfaces

* **Normalized:** This library makes it painless to pull normalized data about COVID19. This library addressed a key issue
with data aggregators on the web today. The manner in which they obtain and parse their data is not clear to the public.
It is the opinion of our team that your data is only as good as the way it was obtained and processed. Inviting the broader community
to contribute to our efforts enables us to incorporate more sources and to be fully transparent about how we get our data.
* **Tested:** All additions to this library require automated testing. Fortunately the way the interfaces are designed, lends itself
to easy automated testing and external validation. All pull requests require integration with our testing framework.
* **Modular:** This library is designed to allow developers to use one data source, or all of them; whatever your needs are.
We have a registry class that you can pull specific source types and regions from. The library is designed to scale up to hundreds
of different sources, so make a PR today!
